# Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)

## Info
|||
|:-:|:-:|
|FileFormat| Text-XML |

Imageformat that saves imagedata as "how to generate" not the rawdata itself.<br>
This reduces the file size on geometric symbols significantly.<br>
As natural images, like from a camera, cant be easy expressed in geometric forms, this format will not work.

## Structure
As this file is in the XML format, a XML parser is recommened here.
