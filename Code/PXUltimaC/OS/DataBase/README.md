# Database
## Info
Databases are programs or services that provide a container for any kind of data.<br>
Most important, the key element that makes it differnt from a simple container is the ability to 
ensure and protect data integrety, however it will be implemented. 
These systems can contain simple storage as a Key-Value pair, Tuples, a collection of values or relational dependend information.
Key-Value pair are well-known as an object like a Dictionary or HashMap. Those provide for a fast and easy lookup.

### [NoSQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL) / noREL (non relational data)
This is a solution to the problem relational orianted systems cause. 
As the data structure is dictated by a defined scheme, data that is not 
fitting to the stucture cant be managed or force the scheme to be updated. 
Additionally, when values in a data-row, that are to be added, do not exist, 
it can happen that due to data integrity you cant add any data at all. 
This problem is amplified the bigger the table grows. 

So, because data is stored more loosely, the data has less integrity but added flexibility.
You may add values connected to the key that are not specified, as a scheme is not needed.
