# Hierarchical-List
## Info
A container that manages a list of references to objects.<br>

## Advantage
- Fast reference walking
- Relative low overhead and cost

## Disadvantage

## Structure
The References can be of the following:
- The Parrent
- The next sibling (linked list node)
- The firstborn child (head of a linked list)

## Links
