# List aka ArrayList
## Info
A chain of types tightly packed in memory.<br>
It is the same as an array with the added utility of having functions to add elements and resize automatically when the list is too smal. 

### Advantage
- Fast and easy to use and develop
- An index can be used to access objets directly
### Disadvantage
- Not as easy to add or remove objects 
- Sorting is very expensive, because of copying memory
- Sorting or reallocating can cause stale referennces
